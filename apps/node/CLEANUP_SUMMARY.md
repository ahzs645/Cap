# Test Scripts Cleanup Summary

## What Was Cleaned Up

### Removed Files
- `test.js` - Basic test (replaced by `tests/basic.js`)
- `test-simple.js` - Simple tests (consolidated into `tests/basic.js`)
- `test-comprehensive.js` - Comprehensive tests (split into organized test suites)
- `test-specific.js` - Specific tests (consolidated)
- `test-window.js` - Window-specific tests (integrated into main test suites)
- `test-cancel.js` - Cancellation tests (moved to `tests/advanced.js`)
- `test-comparison.js` - Comparison tests (removed as redundant)
- `test-window-audio.js` - Window audio tests (integrated into audio tests)

### New Organized Structure

```
tests/
├── index.js          # Main test runner
├── basic.js          # Core functionality tests
├── audio.js          # Audio recording tests
└── advanced.js       # Error handling and advanced features

examples.js           # Clean, organized examples
cleanup.js            # Utility to clean test recordings
```

## How to Use

### Running Tests

```bash
# Run all test suites
node tests/index.js

# Run specific test suite
node tests/index.js basic     # Basic functionality
node tests/index.js audio     # Audio recording (play music during tests)
node tests/index.js advanced  # Error handling and edge cases
```

### Running Examples

```bash
# Run all examples
node examples.js

# Run specific example
node examples.js screen   # Screen recording example
node examples.js window   # Window recording example
node examples.js audio    # Audio recording example
node examples.js pause    # Pause/resume example
```

### Cleanup

```bash
# Remove all test recordings
node cleanup.js
```

## Key Improvements

### 1. **Organized Test Structure**
   - Separated concerns into focused test files
   - Clear naming and documentation
   - Proper error handling and cleanup

### 2. **Comprehensive Documentation**
   - Updated README.md with detailed examples
   - Added troubleshooting section
   - Documented audio capture capabilities
   - Added configuration options and output format details

### 3. **Better Examples**
   - Clean, well-commented examples
   - Demonstrates all major features
   - Shows both screen and window recording with audio
   - Includes audio-only recording technique

### 4. **Audio Improvements**
   - Fixed window recording audio (now enabled by default in examples)
   - Documented that `captureSystemAudio: true` works for both screen and window recording
   - Added audio-focused test suite

### 5. **User Experience**
   - Command-line arguments for running specific tests/examples
   - Better error messages and guidance
   - Visual indicators and emojis for better readability
   - Cleanup utility for managing test outputs

## Breaking Changes

⚠️ **None** - All existing functionality remains the same. The API hasn't changed, only the test scripts and documentation have been improved.

## Next Steps

1. The FFmpeg timestamp warnings should be addressed in the Rust audio encoding code
2. Consider adding configuration options for audio quality/bitrate
3. Long recording timeout issue could be investigated further
4. Could add more specific error types for better error handling
